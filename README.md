# Loan Default Prediction

A machine learning project to predict loan defaults using various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost. 
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment using a web application.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features like debt-to-income ratio and IRR calculations.
- **Model Training:** Compares various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost.
- **Deployment:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time loan default predictions.

## Project Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical aspect of risk management for financial institutions, enabling them to make informed decisions about extending credit to borrowers. Predicting the likelihood of default helps in minimizing financial losses and optimizing lending strategies. This project leverages a dataset of historical loan applications to build and evaluate various machine learning models that classify loans as likely to default or not. The models are then deployed in an interactive web application to provide real-time predictions.

## Goals of the Project:
Data-Driven Decision Making: Use historical data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with loan defaults. This enables the development of predictive models that can classify future loan applications effectively.
Feature Engineering and Selection: Apply advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models. This includes creating new features such as debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-income ratio, and internal rate of return (IRR) calculations.
Model Development and Evaluation: Implement various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost, to find the best-performing algorithm. Evaluate these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust performance.
Interpretability and Transparency: Use interpretability tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. This helps in ensuring that the model's decisions are transparent and justifiable, addressing potential issues of fairness and discrimination.
Deployment and User Interaction: Build an interactive web application that allows users to input loan application details and receive predictions in real-time. The app will also display visualizations and explanations to help users understand the factors influencing the predictions.


## Methodology:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
• Data Source: The project uses a dataset from LendingClub, containing detailed information on loan applications, borrower characteristics, and loan performance.
• Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure high-quality input for model training.
• Feature Engineering: Create new features that capture the relationship between the borrower’s financial health and the likelihood of default. Examples include the debt-to-income ratio, length of employment, and credit utilization.
• Class Imbalance Handling: Implement techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the class imbalance issue, where non-default loans significantly outnumber default loans.

Model Development:
• Implement and compare various machine learning models, starting with baseline models like Logistic Regression and then moving on to more sophisticated models like Random Forest and CatBoost.
• Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
• Evaluate models based on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Use confusion matrices to visualize the performance of each model.

Model Interpretability:
• Use SHAP values to interpret model predictions and understand the contribution of each feature. This step is crucial for ensuring the model is not only accurate but also interpretable and explainable.
• Provide visualizations that show the impact of different features on the model’s predictions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

Web Application Development:
• Build an interactive web application using Streamlit or Flask that allows users to input loan details and receive a prediction of the likelihood of default.
• Include visualizations such as bar charts, feature importance plots, and SHAP summary plots to provide users with insights into the prediction process.

## Impact of the Project:
1. Enhanced Risk Management: By predicting loan defaults accurately, financial institutions can better manage their risk portfolios, reducing the likelihood of financial losses due to unpaid loans.
2. Optimized Lending Strategies: The project provides insights into the factors that contribute to loan defaults, enabling institutions to refine their lending criteria and offer personalized loan products.
3. Fair and Transparent Decision-Making: With model interpretability tools, the project ensures that predictions are transparent and based on justifiable criteria, reducing the risk of unfair lending practices and financial discrimination.
4. Scalability and Real-Time Predictions: The deployed web application allows for real-time predictions and can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger user base, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions.
